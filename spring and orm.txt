	upto date
				REVIEW IT - 


	1. step 1 is done - pom.xml is ready
	2. META-INF/persistence.xml
		let me copy it from our previous project
		- we have "MyJPA" in this file

	3. myspring5.xml
		<context:component-scan base-package="com.sbi.dept"/>

	4. so lets create the package 
			com.sbi.dept

	5. now make 3 main things
		Department
		DepartmentRepository <--naming convention is NOT->DAO
			- well any name would do..
			- recommondation is->Repository as ending word
		DepartmentRepositoryImpl

		Observe the @Repository annotation both
		at interface and class

	@Repository
	MusicalIntrument
	|
	@Repository("strings");
	class Guitar {
	}

	MusicalIntrument m  = (MusicalIntrument) container.getBean("drum");
	Guitar g  = (Guitar) container.getBean("drum");
